## Introduction to SpaCell

* **SpaCell** has been developed for analysing spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, which include imaging data of tissue sections and RNA expression data across the tissue sections. The ST data add a novel spatial dimension to the traditional gene expression data, which derive from dissociated cells. The ST data also add molecular information to a typical histological image. Spacell is desinged to integrates the two histopathological imaging and sequencing fields, with the ultimate aim to discover novel biology and to improve histopathological diagnosis.  

* **SpaCell** implements (deep) neural network (NN) models likea multi-input and multi-output autoencoder, transfer learning with or without fine tuning and residual and separable convolutional NN architectures to identify cell types or to predict disease stages. The NN integrates millions of pixel intensity values with thousands of gene expression measurements from spatially-barcoded spots in a tissue. Prior to model training, SpaCell enables users for implement a comprehensive data preprocessing workflow to filter, combine, and normalise images and gene expression matrices. 

## Installation

1. Requirements:  

```
[python 3.6+]
[TensorFlow 1.4.0]
[scikit-learn 0.18]
[keras 2.2.4]
[seaborn 0.9.0]
[opencv 4.1.1]
[pandas 0.25.0]
[pillow 6.1.0]
[python-spams 2.6.1]
[staintools 2.1.2]
...
```
2. Installation:    

2.1 Download from GitHub   

```git clone https://github.com/BiomedicalMachineLearning/Spacell.git```

To meet the requirements, we recommend user to use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) environment:

```
cd Spacell
conda env create -f requirements.yml
```

To activate environment:

```
conda activate SpaCell
```

to exit environment:

```
conda deactivate
```

2.2 Install from PyPi  

```pip install SpaCell```

## Usage

### Configurations

```config.py```

1. Specify the dataset directory and output directory.
2. Specify model parameters.

### 1. Image Preprocessing

```python image_normalization.py```

### 2. Count Matrix PreProcessing

```python count_matrix_normalization.py```

### 3. Generate paired image and gene count training dataset

```python dataset_management.py```

### 4. Classification

```python spacell_classification.py```

### 5. Clustering

```python spacell_clustering.py -i /path/to/one/image.jpg -l /path/to/iamge/tiles/ -c /path/to/count/matrix/ -e 100 -k 2 -o /path/to/output/```

*  `-e` is number of training epochs
*  `-k` is number of expected clusters

### 6. Clustering Validation and Quantification

```python spacell_validation.py -d /path/to/data -a annotation.png -w wsi.jpeg -m affine_tranformation_matrix.txt -o output_folder -k clustering_predictions.tsv -c annotation_colour_range```

* `-c` is annotation colour range thresholds - blue_low green_low red_low blue_upper green_upper red_low
* `-t` indicates that annotations are not closed paths, so spacell with try to close the paths
* `-f` downscale factor if the input whole slide image has already been downscaled
* `-s` spot size, optional, usually set automatically
